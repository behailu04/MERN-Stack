        React is an open-source Javascript library maintained by Facebook used for creating views rendered in HTML. React is declarative, component-based, no templates and Isomorphic[ the same code can run on both server and the browser].

        Node.js is JavaScript outside of a browser. Node.js runtime runs JavaScript programs. Node.js has an asynchronous event-driven, non-blocking I/O model as opposed to using threads to achieve multitasking.

        ExpressJS is a framework that simplifies the task of writing your server code. Express uses middleware for custom pieces of codes.

        MongoDB is NoSQL document-oriented database, with a flexible schema and a JSON-based query language.
